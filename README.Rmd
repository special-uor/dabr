The goal of dabr is to provide functions to manage databases: select, update, insert,
    and delete records, list tables, backup tables as CSV files, and import
    CSV files as tables.

## Installation

You can install the released version of dabr from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dabr) with:

``` r
install.packages("dabr")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/special-uor/dabr) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("special-uor/dabr", "dev")
```
## Example

Connecting to the Reading Palaeofire Database (RPD), locally installed under the name `RPD-latest`:
```{r}
conn <- dabr::open_conn_mysql("RPD-latest", 
                              password = rstudioapi::askForPassword(prompt = "Password"))
```

Explore the database structure by listing the tables and their attributes:
```{r}
dabr::list_tables(conn)
```

__ALWAYS!__ close your connection to the database (when you are done):
```{r}
dabr::close_conn(conn)
```
